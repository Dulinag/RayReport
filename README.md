# UV Index Chat App

Welcome to our project for Hack Princeton 2023! ðŸš€

## Overview

Our project is a Next.js and Node.js-based web application that provides users with real-time UV index information based on zip codes. Users can input a zip code, and our application will return the UV index along with personalized suggestions for outdoor activities, considering the current UV conditions.

## Features

- **UV Index Chat View**: Users can interact with the app by sending a zip code, and the app responds with the corresponding UV index and tailored recommendations for outdoor activities.

- **Year-long UV Index Graphs**:
  - **New York (1 PM EST)**: ![image](https://github.com/Dulinag/RayReport/assets/71457948/3d243458-6e52-4f9b-9971-64742eaef326)
  - **California (1 PM PST)**: ![image](https://github.com/Dulinag/RayReport/assets/71457948/93b2a7a5-89cc-4280-b9f2-7fae64eddede)

  - Both graphs provide a year-long view with 20 and 25 data points, respectively, showcasing the UV index trend. Both graphs max out at a bit above 3 around the summer time.

## APIs Used

Our project integrates three powerful APIs to enhance its functionality:

1. **GPT AI API**: We leverage GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) AI for natural language understanding and interaction in the chat feature.

2. **OpenUV.io API**: OpenUV.io provides accurate and up-to-date UV index information, ensuring the reliability of our app's data.

3. **OpenWeather API**: OpenWeather API is used to fetch weather-related information, complementing our UV index data.
